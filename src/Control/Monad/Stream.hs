-- This Haskell library provides an implementation of the MonadPlus
-- type class that enumerates results of a non-deterministic
-- computation by interleaving subcomputations in a way that has
-- usually much better memory performance than other strategies with
-- the same termination properties.
-- 
-- By using supensions in strategic positions, the user can ensure
-- that the search does not diverge if there are remaining
-- non-deterministic results.
-- 
-- More information is available on the authors website:
-- <http://okmij.org/ftp/Computation/monads.html#fair-bt-stream>
-- 
-- Warning: @Stream@ is only a monad when the results of @runStream@
-- are interpreted as a multiset, i.e., a valid transformation
-- according to the monad laws may change the order of the results.
